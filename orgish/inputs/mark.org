To markup text in Org, simply surround it with one or more marker characters. *Bold*, /italic/ and _underline_ are fairly intuitive, and the ability to use +strikethrough+ is a plus.  You can _/*combine*/_ the basic markup in any order, however ~code~ and =verbatim= need to be the *_~inner-most~_* markers if they are present since their contents are interpreted =_literally_=.
