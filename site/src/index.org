* hi
this is my /new new new new/ website. it is different from the other ones since it's no longer just some dumb static files.
** who are you
I is cookie. I am in [[https://github.com/ckiee/nixfiles/blob/05f73e74a54bbb3e52e3028528765ea7615173e8/modules/services/mailserver/util.nix#L17][a lot of places]].
- [[][=@ckiee= on Github]]
- [[][=@ckie:ckie.dev= on Matrix]]
- And, [[https://artemis.sh/2022/01/30/discord-holds-the-keys-to-your-heart.html][if you must]], =ckie#8697= on Discord.
*** how'd you get the name "cookie"
I have no idea, it's changed a bit over the years but I don't remember why I picked the /c o o k i e/ specifically.
** what do you do
Sometimes I make things. This website is being served to you with a few thousand lines of Rust since I wrote a good-enough-for-me parser for [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].
